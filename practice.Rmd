```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

If you want to have text hidden from the document:
(there is hidden text under this)

```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
secret comment
```

```{r make-plot, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 8}
storms %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(wind = mean(wind)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = wind)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```

You can use all LaTeX code in .Rmd files, such as:
\newpage 
$2+2$

You can author books or blogs in bookdown or blogdown.

Slides use reveal js (?), which lets you include gifs!

Can also do fact sheets and PDFs.
